Week 1 Learning Summary: Mastering Excel for Data Analysis
This week's focus was on transforming Excel from a basic spreadsheet into a powerful, interactive analysis tool. We covered the end-to-end process, from data import to building a fully professional dashboard.

🚀 Key Excel Skills Mastered

PivotTables (The Foundation):

Mastered summarizing data using all four PivotTable areas (Rows, Columns, Filters, Values).

Performed various calculations beyond SUM, such as COUNT and AVERAGE.

Learned to sort data (e.g., Largest to Smallest) to identify top performers.

PivotCharts (Visualization):

Learned to turn tables into visual stories by selecting the right chart for the data (e.g., Bar charts for comparison, Line charts for trends).

Interactive Dashboards (Core Focus):

Slicers & Timelines: Implemented user-friendly buttons (Slicers) and date filters (Timelines) to make the dashboard dynamic.

Report Connections: Mastered the crucial skill of linking a single Slicer or Timeline to multiple PivotTables and Charts, allowing the entire dashboard to update with a single click.

KPI Cards: Created "headline numbers" (like Total Revenue) by building and formatting small, separate PivotTables.

Data Adaptation & QA:

Applied skills to a complex, real-world movie dataset.

Practiced problem-solving to handle messy data (like JSON) and build analysis on clean columns.

Conducted a final Quality Assurance (QA) test on the completed dashboard.

🧠 Simultaneous CRISP-DM Application

We focused not just on the "how" of Excel, but on the "why" of the project by applying the CRISP-DM framework.

Phase 1: Business Understanding:

Before any analysis, we defined clear Objectives, Business Questions, and measurable Success Criteria.

Prepared a project Glossary for all terminology.

Phase 2: Data Understanding:

Profiled the data and created a document detailing the Data Collection process, Data Descriptions (column meanings), and initial Data Quality checks.

This approach ensured that every technical task in Excel was directly linked to a clear business goal.
